# chicago-crime-analysis

 In this project, we analyze the chicago crime data to predict probability of a crime leading to an arrest.
 We also estimate number of monthly crime incidents that occur.
 
 “Our objective is to use data driven approach to make Chicago a safer place by identifying factors that contribute
 to crime to assist in deploying first responder resources more effectively."
 
  To Fulfill Our Problem Statement, Our Approach Will Be The Following:
• First, we investigate using inferential visualizations to determine different patterns and trends from the data to provide insights on how when and where crimes occur.
• Second, we determine whether occurrence of an arrest is influenced by predictors namely, time of day and type of crime.
• Third, we perform regression analysis to predict Monthly Average Total Crime Incidents and determine whether a crime incident will lead to an arrest or not.
